**House Prices in Boston**

On this project I'll be analyzing a data set consisting of house prices in Boston. I'll be going over the scikit-learn regression model,
as well as how to train the regressor using the fit() method.
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
